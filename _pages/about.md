Hi! I'm currently a Research Fellow at Harvard University in the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu), advised by Prof. [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu). I completed by MS at ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by Prof. [Thomas Hofmann](https://da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann/) in the [Data Analytics Lab](https://da.inf.ethz.ch).
My research focuses on XX.

I spent some time at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov), working on perception for autonomous navigation in extreme off-road terrains in the [RACER challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orLa0mBOKHM).
